weed_group,classification of measured weed,categorical text,,,,rotlen_yrs,crop rotation length,years,positive numeric,The length of time in years to complete one full rotation. ,"This was calculated from the 'soil's' perspective, as how much time elapses between patterns of crops. For example a wheat-maize-wheat rotation would have a rotation length of 2 years. "
cc_spec,cover crop species,categorical text,,,,species_nu,number of crop species in rotation,number,positive integer,The number of unique crop species present in the rotation.,"Note this includes cover crop species if they were present in the rotation. For diverse mixtures of cover crops/pasture we counted it as one species unit, as we felt it was unfair to infalte the species richness calculations based on functionally similar species being grown together as a unit."
cc_type,cover crop type,categorical text,,,,PICV,planting-interval-coefficient-of-variation,number,numeric; NA,Coefficient of variation in number of months between planting events in one complete rotation cycle.,The number of months between planting events for one complete rotation cycle was extracted.

If more than one crop is grown during a year this value may be a fraction. If the values were averaged over many years then this represents the average study age, and may therefore be a fraction. "
