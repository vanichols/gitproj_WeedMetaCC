exp_type is not consistent

. are not consistent, there are some blanks

cc_tillage - all are N, but 4 are .
what does this mean? That none were killed via tillage? 

it isn't clear if . is an explicit NA or not
in general I would recommend having something that indicates it is an intentional
NA (we used 'IC' for it's complicated) to distinguish missing info from
assigned NA values. 

crop_follow what does corn/soy mean?

What variables are of interest? 
term method (2: herb, mech, dual, winterkill). Could collapse? 
Species (grass vs non-grass vs mix?)
Time of weed msmt (summer, spring, fall)
biomass (continuous)
crop follow (corn vs soybean)

maybe add aridity (continuous) 

weather variables? we don't have weather data.
we only have 15 studies, so we COULD get weather. 

climate - we have aridity. let's include it. 

-type of weed msmt (single species? or a community?) most are community? can we add this?

What are the response variables?
density and biomass
yield?
